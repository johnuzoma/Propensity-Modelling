### Problem Definition

A fictional online E-Commerce store receives numerous daily visitors to their website, with varying conversion rates—some make purchases, while others do not. Their strategy involves investing in re-targeting efforts for past visitors. Their goal is to enhance the efficiency of this initiative by focusing on those visitors who exhibit a higher likelihood of converting. To achieve this, they need me to help them understand the specific sections of their website where users engage.

### Key questions
1.   Which of the website interactions affect a user's likelihood to purchase?
2.   Can we score visitors from yesterday, to see who the most valuable prospects are?

### Insights
1. Users who checked delivery detail are 25% more likely to purchase than others who didn't. Also, users who saw checkout are 23% more likely to purchase than others who didn't.
2. 1182 (less than 1%) of the total users who visited yesterday are more likely to purchase in future.

### Recommendations
#### 1. Prioritize Re-targeting Efforts on High-Engagement Sections

- Delivery Detail Page: Users who checked the delivery details are 25% more likely to purchase. Therefore, prioritize these users in your re-targeting campaigns. You can create specific ads highlighting easy and fast delivery options to further entice these users.
- Checkout Page: Users who viewed the checkout page are 23% more likely to purchase. Tailor re-targeting ads to remind these users of the items they left in their cart, possibly offering a small discount or free shipping to encourage completion of the purchase.

#### 2. Score and Segment Yesterday’s Visitors

- Use the insights to score yesterday’s visitors based on their interactions with key pages. For example, assign a higher score to those who visited the delivery details and checkout pages.
- Segment these visitors into different re-targeting lists:
  - High Potential Segment: Visitors who checked both delivery details and checkout.
  - Medium Potential Segment: Visitors who checked either delivery details or checkout.
  - Low Potential Segment: Visitors who did not check these sections.

#### 3. Customized Re-targeting Campaigns:

- High Potential Segment: Show personalized ads with reminders of their cart contents and limited-time offers to create urgency.
- Medium Potential Segment: Display ads emphasizing your store’s key benefits, such as customer testimonials, easy returns, or ongoing promotions.
- Low Potential Segment: Use broader ads highlighting popular products, upcoming sales, or new arrivals to re-engage their interest.

#### 4. Monitor and Adjust:

- Continuously monitor the performance of these segments. Track metrics such as click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates, and return on ad spend (ROAS).
- Adjust your strategy based on the performance data. For example, if the high potential segment is converting very well, consider increasing your budget for this segment.

#### 5. Enhanced Personalization:

- Utilize the collected data to personalize email campaigns as well. Send follow-up emails to high and medium potential segments, highlighting their recently viewed products, offering exclusive discounts, or reminding them of items left in their cart.

#### 6. Optimize Website for Key Interactions:

- Ensure that the delivery details and checkout pages are easy to navigate and provide all necessary information. A streamlined, user-friendly interface on these pages can increase the likelihood of conversion.
- Consider adding features such as estimated delivery dates, various payment options, and trust badges on the checkout page to enhance user confidence.
