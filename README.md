# Problem Definition

A fictional online E-Commerce store receives numerous daily visitors to their website, with varying conversion ratesâ€”some make purchases, while others do not. Their strategy involves investing in re-targeting efforts for past visitors. Their goal is to enhance the efficiency of this initiative by focusing on those visitors who exhibit a higher likelihood of converting. To achieve this, they need me to help them understand the specific sections of their website where users engage.

### Key questions
1.   Which of the website interactions affect a users likelyhood to purchase?
2.   Can we score visitors from yesterday, to see who the most valuable prospects are?
